# PKZ Extract
Bayonetta 3 PKZ extractor

To use, first install Python3 if you haven't already. You also need to download "ooz.exe" from [here](https://github.com/powzix/ooz/releases/) and place it next to the .py script.
After that, just drag and drop any ".pkz" files onto pkz.py

Thanks to NWPlayer123 for the base code and thanks to powzix for ooz (Oodle Kraken compression).
