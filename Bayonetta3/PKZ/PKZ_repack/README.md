# PKZ Repacker
Requires Python 3.

## Installation: 
Download the .py script, get "ooz.exe" from [here](https://github.com/powzix/ooz/releases/) and place it next to the .py script.
You also need to find a "oo2core_7_win64.dll" and place it next to the exe, you could get it from Warframe on Steam or any other game that uses Oodle compression.

## How to use:
Add files that you wish to replace to a "replacement" folder next to the script (.py file) and drag the pkz you wish to modify onto the .py script.
The script will replace files inside the PKZ and make a new pkz file.

Thanks to cabalex for the original Astral Chain script and powzix for ooz (Oodle Kraken compression).
